# Reddit Data Engineering Pipeline

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data engineering pipeline that extracts Reddit post data, processes it, and stores it in AWS for further analytics. It combines **Python**, **Apache Airflow**, **Celery**, **PostgreSQL**, and various **AWS services** including **S3**, **Glue**, **Athena**, and **Redshift**.
